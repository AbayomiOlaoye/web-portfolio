          In my role as a web developer, I had the opportunity to work on the official website of El-kanis
          & Partners, a leading agric tech company making waves in Nigeria and Africa as a whole. My primary
          responsibility was to convert the medium-fidelity wireframe into a visually appealing and user-friendly webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          From ideation to deployment, I collaborated closely with the UI/UX team to enhance the user experience and interface by
          leveraging their expertise to create an intuitive website that effectively communicated El-kanis &
          Partners&apos; mission and offerings.
        </p>
        <p>
          By combining my technical skills at creating reusable components and leveraging React Hooks with a keen eye for aesthetics, I successfully transformed the wireframe into a cohesive
          and engaging web presence for El-kanis & Partners. It was a fulfilling experience that allowed me to contribute to the
          company&apos;s growth in the digital space and showcase my dedication to crafting exceptional and fully optimized online experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learnt a lot working on this project, especially in the area of working with a team of industry-expert designers. I was able to implement efficient
          and scalable solutions to complex problems like routing, complex positioning, logic generally, and I look forward to working on more projects like this.

        <p>
          This is a very fun project that I built using Redux to manage the seaming complex nature of the states to ensure an all-time
          and real-time updating of users&apos; inputs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also used Framer Motion to animate the components and give the app a nice feel. I had a nice experience with creating
          reducers and actions for the React components but for scalability and maintainability issues, I hope to build a similar
          project using newly evolving state management technologies like like Jotai and RxJS for state management.

          It was particularly fun and fulfilling when my previous learning on User Experience was beneficial in avoiding a potential conflict
          that could have blocked us from meeting up with the deadline while designing our database system (Entity Relational Diagram). I contributed
          a great deal in the creation user-friendly interfaces, and fixed a bug that was preventing the app from working as expected.
          - specifically, the <code>deleteDoctor()</code> method in the <kbd>doctor&apo;s</kbd> controller logic was not working as expected.<br />
          After a brief series of debugging to ensure that the routes were configured correctly, I was able to fix it by changing the <code>doctor</code> to <code>doctor_id</code> in the <code>params</code> of the <code>deleteDoctor()</code> method.

          I think I used Redux a lot in most of my applications. I love the way it manages states and makes it easy to share data across components especially in a complex app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Redux offers centralized state management, predictable state changes, time travel debugging, easy collaboration, component decoupling,
          middleware support, and a vast ecosystem with a strong community.
        </p>
        <p>
          With one other developer, we built this app using Redux to manage the states and React Hooks to manage the components. It might be the first time
          we were using conditional rendering in React, and it was a nice experience. <br /><br />With it, you can book a rocket, cancel a booking, and join a mission.

          In this pseudo project, I was working with modularizing codes into maintainable units and components using ES6 syntaxes and modules.

          In programming, modularization is a technique that separates the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules.
          It is a way of organizing programs into separate, discrete, and independent parts. It makes code cleaner to write, easier to understand, maintain, and test.

        <p>It makes me more concerned about my PROCESSES than I was about was RESULTS.</p>
        <p>It endeared me to the use of JavaScript ES6 Syntax (modules, arrow functions, let, const, destructuring, etc.) because of the improvements it avails,
          aside from my experience with bundling web assets with Webpack, and using npm packages/libraries.
